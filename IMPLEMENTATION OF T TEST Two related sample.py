'''Eleven schoolboys were given a test in Statistics. They were given a Monthâ€™s tuition and second 
tests were held at the end of it. Do the marks give evidence that the students have benefited 
from the exam coaching? 
Marks in 1st test: 23 20 19 21 18 20 18 17 23 16 19
Marks in 2nd test: 24 19 22 18 20 22 20 20 23 20 18
Hypothesis 
H0: The students have not benefited from the tuition class. i.e., d = 0 
H1: The students have benefited from the tuition class. i.e., d < 0 
Where, d = x-y; d is the difference between marks in the first test (say x) and marks in the 
second test (say y). '''
